# Sparse_Dictionary_Learning_BFGS
This repository focuses on spectral super-resolution using sparse-based machine learning, with the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm. Our aim is to reconstruct high-resolution multi- or hyperspectral images from limited spectral observations, leveraging BFGS for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.
